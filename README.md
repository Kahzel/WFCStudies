# WFCStudies
Keeping my own studies of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm implementations in Unity

# Wave Function Collapse

* The original implementation of the algorithm was done by Maxim Gumin over at https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse
* The implementation on the Old_WFC folder was based from Sunny Valley's Unity implementation of the Overlapping method for the WFC algorithm, at https://github.com/SunnyValleyStudio/WaveFunctionCollapseUnityTilemapTutorial/
* The Chunkcell WFC folder contains the WIP of my own implementation of the Simpletiled method, with extra constrains being considered, such as symmetry, tile variations (weighted or otherwise) and a bigger tile group (hence the name chunk) rather than individual tiles from a tileset, to account for more space needed per cell.
